This is a Cloud-Enbled android application which not only let users chat anonymously with anyone (having the application)
but let them rate the different ideas popping up and also get aquainted with the events going on, its description and venue
and everything else that is necessary.

Initially this app was just meant to be used by a particular group of students for their comfort (No need for the poster pasting or 
even going from class to class announcing) but its increased usage has left the developers (us) thinking to update it, modify
its UI and let everyone enjoy this good deed of ours.
